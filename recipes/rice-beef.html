                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus 1 tsp</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp Tesco Massaman curry paste</li>
                    <li>150g Tesco diced onion</li>
                    <li>3 cardamom pods</li>
                    <li>2 baking potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1cm cubes (no need to peel)</li>
                    <li>400ml tin coconut milk</li>
                    <li>360g sirloin steak</li>
                    <li>1 red chilli, deseeded and sliced</li>
                    <li>coriander, leaves only, to garnish (optional)</li>
                    <li>basmati rice, to serve</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Method</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat a 1 tbsp of oil in a large saucepan, add the curry paste, onion, cardamom pods and potato. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 mins until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Stir through the coconut milk and simmer for 15 mins, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened and the potato is cooked through.</li>
                    <li>While the potato is cooking, heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan and fry the steaks for 2 mins each side. Remove from the pan and allow to rest while the potato and curry sauce finish cooking. Just before the curry is ready, trim any excess fat from the steak and slice into bite-sized pieces.</li>
                    <li>Stir the steak and resting juices through the curry. Scatter with the sliced chilli and garnish with the coriander leaves, if using. Serve with basmati rice.</li>
                </ol>
